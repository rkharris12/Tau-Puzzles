Puzzle 1

Agent Bunny:

I have the package but I’m under pursuit. I believe our comms are compromised. I’m going to leave a trail of breadcrumbs for you, but I need to keep on the move or the evil octopus Agents will get me. I’ll encode secret messages with the decoder system we share so you can use your cypher to decrypt the final answer. You’re going to have to solve puzzles to get each individual message though. Remember, you’ve got to get through all of these puzzles to secure the package, and keep the evil octopus Agents from getting access to the identities of all of our agents, yourself included. Hopefully this messages gets to you, Bunny. Agent Alpaca out.

- Agent Alpaca


It looks like Agent Alpaca has been kidnapped before he could get his message to his fellow agent from the Agency! Now it’s up to our civilian heroes to retrieve that package! In the name of puzzles and world peace!
